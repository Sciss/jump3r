# jump3r

A copy of an inofficial LAME mp3 library port to Java from https://sourceforge.net/projects/jump3r/

I put this here for future consideration. Mp3 actually sucks and has shitty license and patent things attached to it, even though Fraunhofer seems to have run out of patents by April 2017.
So I probably just use C-lame as a terminal command.
If I ever need to bundle a cross platform mp3 library, perhaps this is it, so I'm saving the source code here. Below is the original readme:

jump3r - Java Unofficial MP3 EncodeR

...is a Java version of lame-3.98.4

Java port created by Ken HÃ¤ndel.
